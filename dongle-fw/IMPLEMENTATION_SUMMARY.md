# Implementation Summary: nRF52840 Dongle Firmware with Nordic S140 SoftDevice

## Overview

Successfully implemented BLE central hub firmware for nRF52840 USB dongle using **Nordic S140 SoftDevice** for easier regulatory qualification.

## Architecture Decision: Why S140 SoftDevice

Switched from `trouble-host` + `nrf-sdc` to **nrf-softdevice (S140)** because:
- ✅ **Pre-qualified**: S140 is already certified by Nordic (FCC, CE, IC, etc.)
- ✅ **Reduced certification effort**: Focus on application, not BLE stack qualification
- ✅ **Official support**: Nordic provides documentation and support
- ✅ **Industry standard**: Widely used and proven in production
- ✅ **Known compliance**: Established track record for regulatory approval

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dependencies (`Cargo.toml`)
```toml
nrf-softdevice = { git = "https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice", 
                   features = ["defmt", "ble-central", "ble-gatt-client", "s140", "nrf52840"] }
```

### 2. Memory Layout (`memory.kdl`)
```
Flash (1MB):
  - SoftDevice S140: 0x00000-0x26000 (152KB)
  - Application:     0x26000-0xE6000 (768KB)
  - Settings:        0xE6000-0xEC000 (24KB)

RAM (256KB):
  - SoftDevice:      0x20000000-0x20003000 (12KB)
  - Application:     0x20003000-0x20040000 (244KB)
```

### 3. SoftDevice Configuration
- **Central role**: Up to 7 simultaneous connections (`MAX_DEVICES`)
- **ATT MTU**: 256 bytes for larger packet support
- **Connection interval**: 15-30ms for responsive communication
- **External crystal**: XTAL for accurate timing

### 4. Core Modules

#### `main.rs`
- SoftDevice initialization and configuration
- USB device setup
- Task spawning (softdevice_task, usb_task, ble_task)
- HubMsg protocol handling

#### `ble.rs`
- BLE central manager
- Device scanning with UUID filtering
- Connection management for multiple devices
- GATT client framework (discovery/read/write)
- Connection handler per device

#### `usb.rs`
- USB device with VID 0x1915, PID 0x5210
- WinUSB driver support (no INF file needed)
- Bulk endpoints for HubMsg protocol
- Power-only VBUS detection (SoftDevice manages interrupts)

#### `storage.rs`
- Device UUID management (up to 7 devices)
- Thread-safe storage with async mutex
- Placeholder for persistent flash storage

## HubMsg Protocol Support

### Implemented Messages
- ✅ `RequestDevices` - Get list of configured devices
- ✅ `SendTo` - Send packet to specific device
- ✅ `ReadVersion` - Get firmware version
- ✅ `DevicePacket` - Forward packets from devices
- ✅ `DevicesSnapshot` - Return list of UUIDs

### Pending Protocol Extensions
- ⏳ `AddDevice(Uuid)` - Add device to bond list
- ⏳ `RemoveDevice(Uuid)` - Remove device from list

## Build & Flash Process

### One-Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Flash S140 SoftDevice (152KB at 0x00000)
probe-rs download --verify --binary-format hex \
  --chip nRF52840_xxAA s140_nrf52_7.3.0_softdevice.hex

# 2. Build application
cargo build --release

# 3. Flash application (put dongle in bootloader mode)
cargo run --release
```

### Memory Usage
- SoftDevice: 152KB flash + 12KB RAM
- Application: ~100-200KB flash (optimized with LTO)
- Available: ~600KB flash + 230KB RAM

## TODOs for Production

### Critical
1. **GATT Service Discovery**: Discover ATS-specific service UUIDs
2. **Characteristic Operations**: Read/write/notify for data exchange
3. **Persistent Storage**: Save device UUIDs to flash (sequential-storage)
4. **Error Recovery**: Reconnection logic for dropped connections

### Important
5. **Protocol Extension**: Add `AddDevice`/`RemoveDevice` to protodonge-rs
6. **Bonding/Pairing**: Implement BLE security and bond management
7. **Connection Pool**: Manage multiple concurrent connections efficiently
8. **LED Indicators**: Status feedback (scanning, connected, error)

### Nice-to-Have
9. **DFU Support**: Over-the-air firmware updates
10. **Diagnostics**: Connection quality metrics, RSSI monitoring
11. **Power Management**: Low-power modes when idle
12. **Watchdog**: System recovery from hangs

## Qualification Benefits

Using S140 SoftDevice provides:
- **Modular testing**: Test application layer separately from BLE stack
- **Reduced scope**: Don't need to qualify entire BLE stack
- **Documentation**: Nordic provides test reports and declarations
- **Support**: Nordic can assist with regulatory questions
- **Track record**: Many products successfully qualified with S140

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real hardware**: Flash and verify basic scanning
2. **Implement GATT discovery**: Find ATS service/characteristics
3. **Test data exchange**: Bidirectional packet routing
4. **Add persistent storage**: Flash-based device list
5. **Protocol extension**: Implement AddDevice/RemoveDevice
6. **Testing & validation**: Multi-device stress testing

## Regulatory Considerations

For qualification, document:
- S140 version used (e.g., v7.3.0)
- Configuration parameters (conn_count, MTU, etc.)
- Application-level BLE behavior
- RF test reports from Nordic for S140
- Any modifications to default SoftDevice config

Reference Nordic's qualification documentation and test reports when submitting for certification.
